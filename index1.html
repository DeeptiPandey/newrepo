<h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>

<div>
  <p id="p1">Technology! The word in itself probably bears a plethora of components. Literally, the word just means application of scientific knowledge in practical purposes, but on grounds it may have somewhat different meanings to it. For most of the people round the globe, technology might refer to their cellular devices and such stuff. As for me, technology resides in as simple as a matchstick to artificial intelligence. Infact the way I define technology is like each and everything you see around, that isn't nature's work, is a result of some kind of technology.</p>
    <p id="p2">Let's just take an example. If I were to write this same blog a million years ago, probably I would have been carving all this script on a stone wall. That was the thengoing technology. As for 400 years ago, I would have been using ink and a quill to write on a leather membrane. As of 40 years ago, on a paper using a pen. As for now, on a rectangular device, just touching at arranged pixels. And as for 50 years from now, I guess I won't really need to write anything! I guess I'll just have to think and it'll all be documented itself! Isn't that great huh! Well all these represent the technologies of different times. So that's probably the way I'll define the word technology as!.</p>
