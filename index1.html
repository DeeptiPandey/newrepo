<h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>

<div>
  <p id="p1">Technology! The word in itself probably bears a plethora of components. Literally, the word just means application of scientific knowledge in practical purposes, but on grounds it may have somewhat different meanings to it. For most of the people round the globe, technology might refer to their cellular devices and such stuff. As for me, technology resides in as simple as a matchstick to artificial intelligence. Infact the way I define technology is like each and everything you see around, that isn't nature's work, is a result of some kind of technology.</p>
    <p id="p2">Let's just take an example. If I were to write this same blog a million years ago, probably I would have been carving all this script on a stone wall. That was the thengoing technology. As for 400 years ago, I would have been using ink and a quill to write on a leather membrane. </p>
